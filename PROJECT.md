# Portfolio 2024: Project Plan

## Requirements
- accessible in three languages (German, English, and 日本語)
- displays some creativity and skills
- shows personality
- conveys necessary information

## Concept
- I want the Portfolio to be a one page app that has a settings menu, letting the user set the language, detail, and maybe some colour settings.
- Every blob of text and image should have a comprehensiveness level between 0 and 100, and hsould build itself up/deconstruct itself as the slider is changed.
- It should also be possible to expand individual sections fully manually.
- Software related projects should be highlighted somehow by default, there should also be a button that lets you jump to the next software project
